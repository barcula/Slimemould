What is a slime mold?

Slime mold or slime mould is an informal name given to several kinds of unrelated eukaryotic organisms that can live freely as single cells, 
but aggregate together to form multicellular reproductive structures. 
Slime molds were formerly classified as fungi but are no longer considered part of that kingdom. 
Although not related to one another, they are still sometimes grouped for convenience within the paraphyletic group referred to as kingdom Protista.

# Exercise

We had the task to start any experiment with the slime mold witch might be interesting for working with open CV.
It was neccesairy to think about different conditions witch influence the behavour and the upgrowth of the slime mold. 
Somewhat we know about the slime mold. It seem to live on oat flakes and likes it dark.
For these experiments we used a raspberry pi with an aditional cam to make constantly pictures of the happenings in the petri dish. On the basis of theese pictures it was possible to create short stop motion movies witch helped to understand this impressing thing a bit more.

# Conceptual formulation

The first question i asked myself was : Can the slime mold change it`s color?
So i decided to colorize the oat flakes with food coloring.

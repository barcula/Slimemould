What is a slime mold?

Slime mold or slime mould is an informal name given to several kinds of unrelated eukaryotic organisms that can live freely as single cells, 
but aggregate together to form multicellular reproductive structures. 
Slime molds were formerly classified as fungi but are no longer considered part of that kingdom. 
Although not related to one another, they are still sometimes grouped for convenience within the paraphyletic group referred to as kingdom Protista.
